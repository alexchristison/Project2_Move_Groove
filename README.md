# RUNS + MUSIC (Aka, Moove & Groove)

### The purpose of my webapp is to allow users to input a run they did, and the original intent was that once that run was entered they could then enter music they listend to on the run. However, as the app development evolved the music component became slightly more ancillary. One pivot that resulted was the inclusion of the user being able to add comments to a run. 

### The idea for this webapp came about due to the fact I enjoy running and listening to music on my runs. In fact, I have a spreadsheet with every run I've done since July 11, 2006. When I did GA's Product Management Immersive in early 2015 I envision creating a webapp like this someday, and eight years later it's coming to pass. 

#### USER STORIES:
##### As a user I want ...
- to login to the app, so that I can enter a run
- to be able to log out of the app
- to enter a run, so that I can keep track of my run (see detail in card for entry fields)
- to be able to edit a run I entered, so that I can fix mistakes as needed
- to be able to delete a run, so that ...
- to be able to add a song (or multiple songs) I listened to on a run, so that I can remember what I listed to that day
- to be able to edit the song/songs that I enter, so that I can fix an entry errors
- to POTENTIALLY have ability to add notes to runs and/or music that I've entered
